Adjacency Matrix. 
**Running The Code**
1. Executing Driver.java brings up visual representation of graph. 
2. **BFT:** User is prompted to enter (non-casesensitive) label of vertex - e.g. "a", "B". 
3. Program will print BFT in order and wait for next input. 
4. Enter any non-existing vertex to continue to DFT. 
5. **DFT:** same as (2) and (3). 
6. Enter any non-existing vertex to exit program.
